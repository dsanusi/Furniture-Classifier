# Furniture-Classifier
A machine learning model is used to classify beds, sofas and chairs

##Technologies Used
  HTML
  Python
  Docker

## Steps Followed
1. Data Preprocessing: Loaded the dataset and performed preprocessing steps such as resizing the images, splitting the data into training and validation sets, and data augmentation. utils.py

2. Model Architecture: Selected a deep learning model architecture; Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and defined the model architecture. model.py

3. Model Training: Trained the model on the training dataset using an optimizer and loss function. model.py, detect.py

4. Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model performance on the validation dataset and fine-tune the model if necessary. detect.py

5. Predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on new images. flaskapp.py
